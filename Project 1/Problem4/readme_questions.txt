The number of pipes necessary in this problem PER process varies depending on format style, givens, and restrictions on code. It would be possible to use only one pipe for all of the children processes granted an expression is broken into two pieces, with the second one being broken down as a child process for another numerical calculation. However, if we are writing a program that gives the user freedom to enter any numerical expression to be computed, one pipe must be used for every numerical operand.
