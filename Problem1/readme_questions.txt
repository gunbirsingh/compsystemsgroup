1. If root process A is terminated prematurely, then all of its children processes become zombies, the task at hand is not completed, and resources are midhandled.
2. I was very confused with this question as to what pid() is supposed to be used for. If you meant getppid() in this case instead. Displaying the tree with root getpid() is difference than getppid() bc issuing command getpid() gives you the process id of the current process, doing this at the root will give you its process. However, issuing command getppid() gives you the process id of the parent process. Issuing this at the root process would create an issue because the root process has no parent process.
3. The maximum number of trees that can be generated depends on the system that it is running on, mainly it depends on the amount of memory/resources that is available. More memory means there is more room for multiple processes to be running, and vice versa.
